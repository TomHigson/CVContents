I was responsible for assessing the safety of advanced driver assistance systems. A demonstration of some of the systems I contributed to can be seen in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdKrCWDaAg)

My contributions included:
- Delivered safety cases for autonomy level 1 (hands on) applications
	- Led an activity to adapt a passenger vehicle safety case for trucks
	- Analysed the safety impact of different sensor configurations
	- Worked alongside project managers to plan system and safety milestones
	- Acted as the primary point of contact between prototype and project development teams
- Assisted in developing concepts for autonomy level 2 (hands off) systems
- Trained 40 engineers in safety engineering with Model Based Systems Engineering
