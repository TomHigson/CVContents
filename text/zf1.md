I was responsible for assessing the safety of advanced driver assistance systems. A demonstration of some of the systems I contributed to can be seen in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdKrCWDaAg).

- We delivered safety cases for autonomy level 1 (hands on) applications.
- I assisted in developing concepts for autonomy level 2 (hands off) systems.
- I trained 40 engineers in safety engineering with Model Based Systems Engineering.
