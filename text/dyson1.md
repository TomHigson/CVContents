I helped identify the weak points and most valuable opportunities to prioritise platform work across a group of 9 scrum teams

Half of all the year's traffic is concentrated into the Christmas period; our mission was to ensure we could cope with this for 2019 peak trading

During my time as product owner, the team achieved:
- Zero downtime during the peak trading window for the first time in the site's history
- Migrated from a monolithic, unsupported, legacy identity management system to a modern, modular architecture, removing vendor lock-in and eliminating long-ongoing scaling issues
- Recognition from Which in their 2019 website rankings as the #6 electronics sales site, beating notable competition including Apple and Amazon
