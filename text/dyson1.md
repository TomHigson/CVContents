I identified weak points and prioritised the most valuable opportunities for platform work across a group of 9 scrum teams.

Half of all the year's traffic is concentrated into the Christmas period; we ensured we could cope with this for the 2019 peak trading period by identifying and fixing bottlenecks in Dyson’s international website’s cloud architecture.

-	We achieved zero downtime during the peak trading window for the first time in the site's history.
-	We migrated the identity management system from a monolithic, unsupported, legacy system to a modern, modular architecture, removing vendor lock-in and eliminating long-ongoing scaling issues.
-	Our work contributed to Which recognising our site as the #6 electronics site (2019), beating notable competition including Apple and Amazon.
-	I brought accounting into the engineering process to introduce cost accountability and reduce idle resource costs by 50%.
