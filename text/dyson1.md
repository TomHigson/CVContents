For this short term contract I helped Dyson prepare for and operate over the 2019 peak trading period by becoming the product owner for their UK, Canada and USA e-commerce platform.

I worked with a wide range of stakeholders to:
- Set the platform themes to give clear direction to developers
- Modify the processes to be more agile
  - Introduced earlier product owner assessments, allowing issues to be found earlier
  - Worked collaboratively with the team to create a new definition of done
  - Empowered developers by connecting them directly to stakeholders

During my time as product owner, the team achieved:
- Zero downtime during the peak trading window for the first time in the site's history
- Recognition from Which in their 2019 website rankings as the #6 electronics sales site, beating notable competition including Apple and Amazon
