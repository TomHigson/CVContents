As the product owner for their UK, Canada and USA e-commerce platform, I helped Dyson prepare for and operate over the 2019 peak trading period. Almost half of all the year's traffic is concentrated into the Christmas period, our mission was to ensure we could cope with this.

I worked with a wide range of stakeholders to:
- Set the platform goals to give clear direction to other product managers and developers
- Modify the processes to be more agile
  - Introduced earlier product owner assessments, allowing issues to be found earlier
  - Worked collaboratively with the team to create a new definition of done
  - Empowered developers by connecting them directly to stakeholders

During my time as product owner, the team achieved:
- Zero downtime during the peak trading window for the first time in the site's history
- Recognition from Which in their 2019 website rankings as the #6 electronics sales site, beating notable competition including Apple and Amazon
