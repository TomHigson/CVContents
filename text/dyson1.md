As the product owner for their UK, Canada and USA e-commerce platform, I helped Dyson prepare for and operate over the 2019 peak trading period by setting the themes and prioritised objectives for 2 quarters. Almost half of all the year's traffic is concentrated into the Christmas period, our mission was to ensure we could cope with this.

During my time as product owner, the team achieved:
- Zero downtime during the peak trading window for the first time in the site's history
- Recognition from Which in their 2019 website rankings as the #6 electronics sales site, beating notable competition including Apple and Amazon
