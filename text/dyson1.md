I am product owner for the Dyson e-commerce platform, which provides a centralised environment for business experts to host the Dyson set of global web apps.

I work with a wide range of stakeholders to ensure the platform is:
- Aligned with the current and future business themes
- Well architected with small, modular components that do not force lock-in to vendors
- Scalable to current and future needs
- Robust and secure
- Cost effective and meets quality expectations
