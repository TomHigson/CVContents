I manage an agile team tasked with catching up to and getting ahead of the baseline, must-have features for the marketplace, as the market shifts.

This includes managing and communicating the product vision, roadmap and priorities across the team and stakeholders.
 
Highlights include:
- Baselining our product offering against competitors
- Creating a stakeholder engagement plan to coordinate the company's product group's interactions with stakeholders and establish communication responsibilities on all sides
- Building a strong relationship of trust across the stakeholder group so they can be comfortable trading requirements, even late into development
- Working with a team of experts to make difficult balancing decisions between:
  - Reducing technical debt vs. creating new features
  - Satisfying localised needs vs. creating generic, widely valuable features
  - Satisfying short-term improvements vs. strategic market alignment
