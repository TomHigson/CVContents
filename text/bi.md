Reporting into the head of product, I am the most senior product manager for our core Software as a Service offering, worth approximately Â£20 Million in annual recurring revenue.
 
The board management industry is now crowded with a plethora of emerging cheap options. My role is to ensure we keep ahead of the marketplace by prioritising the features board members really want while ensuring we incorporate that certain something that makes Board Intelligence special - its broad knowledge of what makes a successful board, gained from decades of consultancy.
 
Highlights include:
- Baselining our product offering against competitors
- Creating a stakeholder engagement plan to coordinate the company's product group's interactions with stakeholders and establish communication responsibilities on all sides
- Building a strong relationship of trust across the stakeholder group so they can be comfortable trading requirements, even late into development
- Working with a team of experts to make solutions that balance:
  - Reducing technical debt vs. creating new features
  - Satisfying localised needs vs. creating generic, widely valuable features
  - Satisfying short-term needs vs. strategic market alignment
