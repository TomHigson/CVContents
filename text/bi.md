As the most senior product manager for Board Intelligence’s primary Software as a Service offering, worth £20 Million in annual recurring revenue, I helped Board Intelligence keep ahead of rapidly emerging competition by infusing their unique domain knowledge into their products.
-	I created a roadmap to balance the needs of few large and many small clients using value analysis.
-	I simplified the product offerings to bring more value to smaller clients and reduce the manual testing effort by 20%.
-	I built a strong relationship of trust with key stakeholders, making them comfortable trading requirements, even late into development.
- I baselined our product offering against competitors.
- I created a stakeholder engagement plan to coordinate the company's product group's interactions with stakeholders and establish communication responsibilities.
