I managed an agile team tasked with providing customers with new, inspirational opportunities to try new items within the Ocado Smart Platform e-commerce website.

Highlights include:
-	Working with global retail partners of different cultures and markets to agree future visions
- Retaining enough agility to adapt to unprecedented demand and sudden market change
