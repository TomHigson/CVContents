I manage an agile team tasked with providing customers with new, inspirational opportunities to try new items within the Ocado Smart Platform e-commerce website.

This includes managing and communicating the product vision, roadmap and priorities across the team and all stakeholders.

Highlights include:
-	Working with global retail partners of different cultures and markets to agree future visions
- Building a strong relationship of trust across the stakeholder group so they can be comfortable trading requirements, even late into development
- Retaining enough agility to adapt to unprecedented demand and sudden market change
- Working with a team of experts to make difficult balancing decisions between:
  - Reducing technical debt vs. creating new features
  - Satisfying localised needs vs. creating generic, widely valuable features
  - Satisfying short-term improvements vs. strategic market alignment
