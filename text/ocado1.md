I managed an agile team within Ocado’s next generation grocery e-commerce solution.

Considering ¾ of the UK workforce eat the same lunch every working day, we worked to eliminate grocery tedium by making it effortless to find alternatives that align with your shopping interests, bringing greater satisfaction and better health.

-	We ranked the relative needs and priorities for a bespoke recommendations engine that now outperforms the old engine across all metrics.
-	We improved the discoverability of key user stories from 30% to 80%.
- I worked with global retail partners of different cultures and markets to agree future visions.
-	I helped the robotics team prioritise work to maximise value using value stream analysis.
