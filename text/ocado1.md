I managed an agile team tasked with providing customers with new, inspirational opportunities to try new items within the Ocado Smart Platform e-commerce website.

Â¾ of the UK workforce eat the same lunch every working day. Our mission was to help people like this easily find alternatives, bringing them greater satisfaction and better health.

Highlights include:
-	Working with experts to workshop new shopping experiences, the technologies they would require and how to launch them to create a positive impression
- Working with global retail partners of different cultures and markets to agree future visions
- Retaining enough agility to adapt to unprecedented demand and sudden market change
