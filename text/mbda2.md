I owned the flight path management aspects of an [urgent operational request for a novel loitering munition](https://www.mbda-systems.com/press-releases/team-lm-launches-fire-shadow-to-meet-uk-mod-loitering-munition-requirement/). This system demanded fast-paced development in a constantly changing field. My contributions included:
- Worked with software suppliers to clarify system boundaries, responsibilities and priorities
- Managed work packages for several systems engineers and test engineers
For my work, I received a Contribution to the Business award at the MBDA 2011 National Awards
