I led a research and development group to better understand and solve the Ministry of Defenceâ€™s problems with app development, integration, and deployment onto distributed military networks. Defence apps are traditionally hard to develop, requiring multi-million-pound investments into physical infrastructure and alignment with many moving dependencies. We helped the UK Army standardise and modernise military app development, opening defence up to wider industry.
