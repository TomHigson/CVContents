I am a [PMI certified](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/024777d4-200b-4730-b72b-fed99fdcdcaf/linked_in_profile) agile product owner with a background in software engineering and software management. I have also acted as an agile coach for large (>£300M) projects.

I have approximately 5 years' experience in product owner and similar roles and 12 years’ software development experience overall. My experience covers a wide range of projects:
- Safety and mission critical systems for automotive and defence projects
- Industry disrupting new concepts and future systems
- From green-field, experimental prototypes to on-site support of legacy systems

Although no longer a developer, I like to keep my knowledge relevant by building in my spare time:
- Small cloud native websites such as [this one to host my CV](http://www.cv.tomhigson.com/)
- Raspberry Pi projects, such as home automation systems and [Pi Holes](https://pi-hole.net/)
- Selenium scripts to automate admin tasks
