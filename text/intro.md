I am a [PMI certified](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/024777d4-200b-4730-b72b-fed99fdcdcaf/linked_in_profile) technical product manager with a background in web development and cloud infrasturcure. As a certified agile practitioner, I also enjoy helping each company I've worked with work towards their agile transition goals.

I have more than 5 years' experience in product roles and 12 yearsâ€™ software experience overall. My passion is to learn new industries, their driving forces and differing product propositions. Then, alonglide domain experts, I love to devise and explore innovative concepts to create products uniquely beloved to their users. So far I've done this for:
- Ocado's grocery e-commerce platform
- Radar and camera systems for automated driving
- Future generation missile weapon systems

Although no longer a developer, I like to keep my knowledge relevant with personal projects such as:
- Small cloud native websites such as [this one to host my CV](https://tomscv.azurewebsites.net/)
- Raspberry Pi projects, such as home automation systems and [Pi Holes](https://pi-hole.net/)
- Selenium scripts to automate repetitive admin tasks
