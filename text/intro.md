I am a technical product manager with 15 yearsâ€™ experience in software development, 6 of which in product roles. My background is in web development and cloud infrastructure.

As a [certified agile practitioner](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/024777d4-200b-4730-b72b-fed99fdcdcaf/linked_in_profile) and [cloud leader](https://www.credential.net/d587f1d3-6734-441d-b7c3-8bddfe440e6e?key=0e630475717660fbeff8592143c0a2cdade8526b4351ba2349a0ab09af5f40e1), I enjoy helping each company I work with progress their agile and digital transformations.

My passion is to solve problems, balancing strategic and creative thinking, to make novel products that people love.

In my personal time I like to refresh my developer skills with personal projects, such as:
- Small cloud native websites such as [this one to host my CV](https://tomscv.azurewebsites.net/).
- Raspberry Pi projects, such as home automation systems and [Pi Holes](https://pi-hole.net/).
- Selenium scripts to automate repetitive admin tasks.
