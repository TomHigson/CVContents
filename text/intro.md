I am a [PMI certified](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/024777d4-200b-4730-b72b-fed99fdcdcaf/linked_in_profile) technical product manager with a background in software engineering. I also have limited experience as an agile coach.

I have more than 5 years' experience in product roles and 12 yearsâ€™ experience overall within software development projects. My experience covers:
- Industry disrupting new concepts and future systems
- Adapting mature systems to better meet changing requirements
- Safety and mission critical systems for automotive and defence projects

Although no longer a developer, I like to keep my knowledge relevant with personal projects such as:
- Small cloud native websites such as [this one to host my CV](https://tomscv.azurewebsites.net/)
- Raspberry Pi projects, such as home automation systems and [Pi Holes](https://pi-hole.net/)
- Selenium scripts to automate admin tasks
