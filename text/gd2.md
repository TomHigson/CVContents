I introduced DevOps practices to Vertex projects by bringing external DevOps consultants into the company. Through this, Vertex and other internal projects have developed a strong DevOps culture and greatly increased both release tempo and feature cycle time.

My project, **S**oft**w**are **i**ntegration and **t**esting **c**ollaboration **h**ome, or **Switch**, opened similar DevOps pipelines to external developers, allowing rapid integration of apps into the [MORPHEUS EvO network architecture](https://www.generaldynamics.uk.com/solutions/c4i-systems/evo/). The Switch concept is highly disruptive for the UK Defence industry, providing app developers unprecedented levels of network integration in far shorter timescales than previously possible.
