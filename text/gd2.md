I introduced DevOps practices to Vertex projects by bringing external DevOps consultants into the company. Through this, Vertex and other internal projects have developed a strong DevOps culture and greatly increased both release tempo and feature cycle time.

**S**oft**w**are **i**ntegration and **t**esting **c**ollaboration **h**ome, or **Switch** intends to open similar DevOps pipelines to external developers to allow rapid integration of apps into the [MORPHEUS EvO network architecture](https://www.generaldynamics.uk.com/solutions/c4i-systems/evo/).

To achieve this, I spend time with 3rd party developers to understand their needs for integrating their applications onto specific hardware and software. I then feed their integration needs into the Switch development team by connecting our engineers with theirs.

Switch emphasises open, collaborative working with shared deployment pipelines, plans, wikis and question and answer systems.
