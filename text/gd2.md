I manage General Dynamicâ€™s **S**oft**w**are **i**ntegration and **t**esting **c**ollaboration **h**ome, or **Switch**. Switch is a DevOps environment intended to rapidly integrate apps into the [MORPHEUS EvO network architecture](https://www.generaldynamics.uk.com/solutions/c4i-systems/evo/).

This involves spending time with 3rd party developers to help them smoothly integrate their applications onto specific military hardware and software. As I do so, I feed their integration needs into the Switch development team by connecting our engineers with theirs.

Switch emphasises open, collaborative working with shared deployment pipelines, plans, wikis and question and answer systems.
