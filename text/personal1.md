This CV is not just a CV, it's an open source web app that:
- Uses Azure
  - The app shell is [running as an Azure App Service](coming soon)
  - The CV content is stored in Azure blob storage, accessed using Azure active directory authentication
  - Deployment is automatic, using Azure DevOps
  - Metrics are tracked and reported using Azure Application Insights
- Leverages properly formatted Angular structuring to allow component reuse
- Is reactive to different display sizes
- Provides properly formatted printing using media queries
- (coming soon) is service worker ready

As my work is typically security controlled and so cannot be shared, I hope this CV helps demonstrate some of my technical abilities. Check out [the repository](https://github.com/TomHigson/CV) for more details
